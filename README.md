## Pycairo examples - A picture is worth a thousand words

### What is this repo for

Beautiful pictures with cool codes will attract more users and make it easier for beginners to learn this library.

While [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/) / [Pycairo](https://github.com/pygobject/pycairo) / [cairocffi](https://github.com/Kozea/cairocffi) is a great tool for drawing vector graphics and there are not a few tutorials, it seems that it lacks some amazing examples as [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) / [gnuplot](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_5.0/) / [TikZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/all/) / [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery) / [p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/) / ... has.

Thus, I want to show the flexibility and power of Cairo / Pycairo / cairocffi **by examples**.

I choose Pycairo to create these examples -- it is not hard to reproduce them with Cario or cairocffi.

## Existing Resources

Of course, there has been some useful resources. These resources are good, and if you want to implement some more complicated effects which my examples do not cover, those 'tedious' api references may help a lot.

Well, since this repo is not intented to be something like 'awesome-cairo', I just pick several 'official' resources here. You can explore the Internet to find more resources.
